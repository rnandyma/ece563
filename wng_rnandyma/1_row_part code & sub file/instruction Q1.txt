To compile the code using the following command
mpicc -std=c99 row_part_send_recv.c -o row_part_send_recv -lm
Then run the sub files for 'x' number of processors. For 16 processors run the sub file named 1_16.sub, for 4 procs run 1_4.sub
and for 1 proc run 1_1.sub
Submit using the following command
qsub -n ./subfile.sub
In the sub file you can set the number of nodes and processor per node and the wall time for the job to be submitted.
A sample .o file is in the directory
